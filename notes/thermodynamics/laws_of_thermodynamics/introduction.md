# Laws of Thermodynamics

The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental principles that describe how energy moves within a physical system.

## Zeroth Law
If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

## First Law (Law of Energy Conservation)
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
$$ \Delta U = Q - W $$

## Second Law
Entropy of an isolated system never decreases; processes occur in a direction that increases overall entropy.
$$ \Delta S \geq 0 $$

## Third Law
As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero.

## Applications

1. **Heat Engines**
2. **Refrigeration Systems**
3. **Chemical Reactions**
