# Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, temperature, and the statistical behaviors of systems with a large number of particles. It describes how energy is transferred within physical systems.

## Fundamental Laws

1. **Zeroth Law**: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
2. **First Law (Law of Energy Conservation)**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
   $$ \Delta U = Q - W $$
3. **Second Law**: Entropy of an isolated system never decreases; processes occur in a direction that increases overall entropy.
   $$ \Delta S \geq 0 $$
4. **Third Law**: As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero.

## Key Concepts

### Entropy
A measure of the disorder or randomness in a system.

### Enthalpy
A measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system, including internal energy and the product of pressure and volume.
$$ H = U + PV $$

### Heat Engines
Devices that convert heat energy into mechanical work, operating between two reservoirs at different temperatures.

## Applications

Thermodynamics is essential in various fields:
1. **Engineering**: Designing engines, refrigerators, and HVAC systems.
2. **Chemistry**: Understanding reaction energetics and equilibria.
3. **Biology**: Studying metabolic processes and energy transfer in living organisms.
4. **Meteorology**: Explaining weather patterns and atmospheric phenomena.
