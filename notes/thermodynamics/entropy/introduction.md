# Entropy

Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. It plays a crucial role in the second law of thermodynamics and determines the direction of spontaneous processes.

## Key Concepts

### Statistical Definition
Entropy \( S \) can be defined in terms of the number of microscopic configurations \( \Omega \):
$$ S = k_B \ln \Omega $$

### Entropy Change
For reversible processes:
$$ dS = \frac{dQ_{\text{rev}}}{T} $$

## Implications

- **Irreversibility**: Natural processes tend to increase the total entropy of the universe.
- **Thermodynamic Probability**: Systems evolve towards states with higher entropy.

## Applications

1. **Chemical Reactions**
2. **Information Theory**
3. **Statistical Mechanics**
