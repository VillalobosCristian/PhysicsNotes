# Heat Engines

Heat engines are devices that convert thermal energy into mechanical work by exploiting temperature differences between a hot and a cold reservoir.

## Key Components

1. **Working Substance**: The medium (e.g., gas, steam) that undergoes thermodynamic cycles.
2. **Heat Source and Sink**: Reservoirs that supply and absorb heat.
3. **Engine Mechanism**: Components like pistons or turbines that convert energy.

## Thermodynamic Cycles

### Carnot Cycle
A theoretical cycle that provides the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two temperatures.

### Otto Cycle
The idealized cycle for spark-ignition internal combustion engines.

### Diesel Cycle
The idealized cycle for compression-ignition internal combustion engines.

## Efficiency
The efficiency \( \eta \) of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of work output to heat input:
$$ \eta = \frac{W}{Q_H} $$

### Carnot Efficiency
$$ \eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} $$

## Applications

1. **Internal Combustion Engines**
2. **Steam Turbines**
3. **Refrigerators and Heat Pumps**
