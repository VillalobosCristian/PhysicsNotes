# Introduction to Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics forms the foundation of physics, describing the motion of macroscopic objects.

## Key Concepts

1. Motion and Forces
2. Energy and Work
3. Momentum and Collisions

## Mathematical Foundation

The fundamental equation of classical mechanics is Newton's Second Law:

$$ F = ma $$

This equation relates force ($F$), mass ($m$), and acceleration ($a$).
