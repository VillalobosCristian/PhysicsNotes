# Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics is the foundation of physics, dealing with the motion of objects under the influence of forces.

## Overview

This section covers the fundamental principles of classical mechanics, including:

- [[kinematics|Kinematics]]: The study of motion
- [[dynamics|Dynamics]]: The study of forces and their effects
- [[energy|Energy and Work]]: The study of energy and its conservation

## Key Concepts

Each area builds upon previous knowledge:

1. First, we study [[one-dimensional-motion|motion in one dimension]]
2. Then, we explore [[newtons-laws|Newton's Laws of Motion]]
3. Finally, we examine [[conservation_laws|conservation principles]]

$$ F = ma $$

This fundamental equation forms the basis of classical dynamics.
