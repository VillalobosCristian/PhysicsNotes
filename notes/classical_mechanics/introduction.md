# Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics forms the foundation of physics, describing the motion and interaction of macroscopic objects. This branch of physics provides the mathematical framework for understanding everything from the motion of planets to the oscillations of springs.

## Overview

Classical mechanics is built upon several fundamental concepts:

1. [[kinematics|Kinematics]]: The study of motion without reference to forces
2. [[dynamics|Dynamics]]: The study of forces and their effects on motion
3. Conservation Laws: Fundamental principles that govern physical systems

## Mathematical Foundation

The language of classical mechanics is mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include:

$$ \vec{F} = m\vec{a} $$

This fundamental equation, Newton's Second Law, relates force ($\vec{F}$), mass ($m$), and acceleration ($\vec{a}$).

## Core Topics

### Kinematics
The study of motion begins with [[one-dimensional-motion|one-dimensional motion]] and extends to more complex scenarios. We analyze quantities such as:

- Position: $x(t)$
- Velocity: $v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}$
- Acceleration: $a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$

### Dynamics
Understanding forces through [[newtons-laws|Newton's Laws]] provides the foundation for:
- Particle dynamics
- Rigid body motion
- Oscillations and waves

## Applications

Classical mechanics finds applications in numerous fields:
1. Engineering
2. Astronomy
3. Sports science
4. Robotics
