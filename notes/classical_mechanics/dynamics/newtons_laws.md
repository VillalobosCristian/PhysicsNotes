# Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's Laws form the foundation of [[classical-mechanics|classical mechanics]], providing the basic principles that govern the motion of objects under the influence of forces.

## The Three Laws

### First Law: Law of Inertia
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a net external force.

Mathematically, when $\sum \vec{F} = 0$:
$$ \vec{v} = \text{constant} $$

### Second Law: Force and Acceleration
The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass:

$$ \vec{F} = m\vec{a} $$

Or in terms of momentum:

$$ \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} $$

### Third Law: Action-Reaction
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction:

$$ \vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21} $$

## Applications

These laws are essential for understanding:
- [[dynamics|Dynamic Systems]]
- [[one-dimensional-motion|Motion Analysis]]
- Conservation Laws

## Example Problems

### Problem 1: Block on an Inclined Plane
For a block on an inclined plane with angle $\theta$:

$$ F_{net} = mg\sin\theta - f $$
where $f$ is the friction force.

### Problem 2: Connected Masses
For two masses connected by a string:

$$ T = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1 + m_2}g $$
where $T$ is the tension in the string.
