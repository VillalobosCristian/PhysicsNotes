# Dynamics

Dynamics, building upon [[kinematics|kinematics]], is the study of forces and their effects on motion. While kinematics describes how objects move, dynamics explains why they move as they do.
Dynamics is the study of forces and motion.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Force
A force is any interaction that, when unopposed, causes a change in motion. The mathematical representation of force:

$$ \vec{F} = m\vec{a} $$

This fundamental equation from [[newtons-laws|Newton's Laws]] relates force to mass and acceleration.

## Types of Forces

1. Contact Forces
   - Normal force: $\vec{N}$
   - Friction: $f = \mu N$
   - Tension: $\vec{T}$

2. Field Forces
   - Gravity: $\vec{F}_g = m\vec{g}$
   - Electric: $\vec{F}_e = q\vec{E}$
   - Magnetic: $\vec{F}_B = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$

## Applications

The principles of dynamics are essential for understanding:
- [[one-dimensional-motion|Motion in One Dimension]]
- Circular Motion
- Oscillations and Waves

## Key Relationships

The work done by a force:

$$ W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} $$

The relationship between force and momentum:

$$ \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} $$
