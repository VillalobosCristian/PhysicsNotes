# Project Workflow

## 1. Project Initialization
- **Set Up Repository**
    - Create a new GitHub repository named `PhysicsNotes-1`.
    - Initialize with a README.md file.
    - Set up `.gitignore` for relevant files.
- **Define Project Structure**
    - Organize directories: `/notes/classical_mechanics/dynamics/`.
    - Create placeholder files for each major topic.

## 2. Planning and Research
- **Outline Topics**
    - List all key areas in classical mechanics and dynamics to cover.
    - Prioritize topics based on importance and complexity.
- **Gather Resources**
    - Collect textbooks, academic papers, and online resources.
    - Bookmark useful websites and reference materials.

## 3. Content Development
- **Write Detailed Notes**
    - For each topic, create comprehensive Markdown files.
    - Include definitions, theorems, proofs, and examples.
- **Incorporate Visuals**
    - Add diagrams, charts, and images to illustrate concepts.
    - Use LaTeX for mathematical equations and expressions.
- **Code Integration**
    - Include relevant code snippets or simulations if applicable.
    - Ensure code is well-documented and executable.

## 4. Review and Editing
- **Proofreading**
    - Check for grammatical errors and typos.
    - Ensure clarity and coherence in explanations.
- **Technical Review**
    - Validate the accuracy of all scientific content.
    - Seek feedback from peers or mentors in physics.
- **Refinement**
    - Update content based on feedback.
    - Improve visual aids and formatting for better understanding.

## 5. Version Control and Collaboration
- **Commit Changes Regularly**
    - Use meaningful commit messages.
    - Commit after completing significant sections.
- **Branch Management**
    - Create branches for major updates or new topics.
    - Merge branches after thorough testing and review.
- **Collaborate with Contributors**
    - Set guidelines for external contributions.
    - Review and integrate pull requests.

## 6. Documentation and Formatting
- **Enhance README.md**
    - Provide an overview of the project.
    - Include a table of contents with links to major sections.
- **Consistent Styling**
    - Use standard Markdown conventions.
    - Maintain uniform heading levels and formatting styles.
- **Navigation Aids**
    - Add hyperlinks between related topics.
    - Include a glossary for key terms and definitions.

## 7. Deployment and Sharing
- **Publish Repository**
    - Make the GitHub repository public for accessibility.
    - Enable GitHub Pages if hosting a static site.
- **Promote the Project**
    - Share on social media, forums, and academic platforms.
    - Engage with the community for wider reach and feedback.
- **Maintain and Update**
    - Regularly update content to reflect new findings or corrections.
    - Monitor issues and respond to queries from users.

## 8. Backup and Security
- **Regular Backups**
    - Ensure the repository is backed up to multiple locations.
- **Access Control**
    - Manage collaborator

## Steps to Create and Add a New Note

1. **Create a New Markdown File**
    - Navigate to the appropriate topic directory within `notes/`.
    - Create a new markdown file following the naming convention, e.g., `new_topic.md`.

2. **Add Note Metadata to `index.json`**
    - Open `notes/index.json`.
    - Add a new entry to the `notes` array with the required fields (`id`, `title`, `path`, etc.).

3. **Implement Content**
    - Write the content for the new note in the markdown file, ensuring proper formatting and linking as needed.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
    - Commit your changes and push them to a new branch.
    - Submit a pull request for review.

5. **Review and Merge**
    - Have your pull request reviewed by project maintainers.
    - Address any feedback and merge the pull request upon approval.

6. **Verify Display**
    - Ensure the new note appears correctly in the application.
    - Check for proper linking and rendering of the content.
