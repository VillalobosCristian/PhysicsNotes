# Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. This fundamental branch of [[classical-mechanics|classical mechanics]] provides the mathematical tools for describing how objects move through space and time.

## Basic Concepts

### Position
The position of an object is defined by its coordinates relative to a reference frame:

$$ \vec{r}(t) = x(t)\hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j} + z(t)\hat{k} $$

### Velocity
Velocity represents the rate of change of position:

$$ \vec{v}(t) = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} $$

### Acceleration
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity:

$$ \vec{a}(t) = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} $$
