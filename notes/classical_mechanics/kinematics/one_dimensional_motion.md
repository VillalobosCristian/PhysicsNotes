# One-Dimensional Motion

As introduced in [[kinematics|kinematics]], one-dimensional motion is the simplest form of movement, where an object moves along a straight line. This foundational concept is essential for understanding more complex motion.

## Basic Equations

### Position Function
The position of an object as a function of time is given by $x(t)$. For constant acceleration:

$$ x(t) = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$

where:
- $x_0$ is the initial position
- $v_0$ is the initial velocity
- $a$ is the acceleration
- $t$ is time

### Velocity
The velocity is the rate of change of position:

$$ v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = v_0 + at $$

### Key Equations
One of the most useful equations relates velocity directly to position:

$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0) $$

## Applications

These concepts form the foundation for understanding more complex topics in [[dynamics|dynamics]] and are essential for comprehending [[newtons-laws|Newton's Laws]].

1. Free Fall Motion:
   $$ y(t) = y_0 + v_0t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$
   where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. Uniform Motion:
   When acceleration is zero:
   $$ x(t) = x_0 + vt $$
