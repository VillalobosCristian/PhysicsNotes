# Special Relativity

Special Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, addresses the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those approaching the speed of light, and introduces the concept that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.

## Key Postulates

1. **Relativity Principle**: The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames.
2. **Constancy of Speed of Light**: The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the light source.

## Key Concepts

### Time Dilation
Moving clocks run slower compared to stationary ones:
$$ \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t $$
where $$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$

### Length Contraction
Objects contract in length along the direction of motion:
$$ L' = \frac{L}{\gamma} $$

### Mass-Energy Equivalence
Expressed by the equation:
$$ E = mc^2 $$

## Applications

1. **Particle Accelerators**
2. **GPS Technology**
3. **Nuclear Energy**
