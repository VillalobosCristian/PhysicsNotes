# General Relativity

General Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in 1915, generalizes Special Relativity to include gravity as a property of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

## Key Concepts

### Spacetime Curvature
Mass and energy cause spacetime to curve, and this curvature dictates the motion of objects:
$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} $$

### Gravitational Time Dilation
Time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields:
$$ \Delta t' = \Delta t \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} $$

### Black Holes
Regions of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing, not even light, can escape from inside.

## Applications

1. **Gravitational Lensing**
2. **Orbit Calculations of Planets and Stars**
3. **Cosmology and the Big Bang Theory**
