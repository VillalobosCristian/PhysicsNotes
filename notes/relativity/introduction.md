# Relativity

Relativity encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: Special Relativity and General Relativity. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.

## Special Relativity

Introduced in 1905, it addresses the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those approaching the speed of light.

### Key Concepts

1. **Time Dilation**: Moving clocks tick slower compared to stationary ones.
2. **Length Contraction**: Objects contract in the direction of motion as they approach the speed of light.
3. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Expressed by the famous equation:
   $$ E = mc^2 $$

## General Relativity

Published in 1915, it generalizes Special Relativity to include acceleration and gravity, describing gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

### Key Concepts

1. **Spacetime Curvature**: Massive objects cause spacetime to curve, affecting the motion of other objects.
2. **Gravitational Waves**: Ripples in spacetime caused by accelerating masses.
3. **Black Holes**: Regions of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing can escape from inside them.

## Applications

Relativity has profound implications and applications:
1. **GPS Technology**: Requires adjustments based on both Special and General Relativity to maintain accuracy.
2. **Astrophysics**: Understanding phenomena like black holes and neutron stars.
3. **Cosmology**: Explaining the expansion of the universe.
