# Magnetic Fields

Magnetic fields are regions around magnets or moving electric charges where magnetic forces are exerted. They play a crucial role in various physical phenomena and technological applications.

## Basic Concepts

### Biot-Savart Law
Describes the magnetic field generated by an electric current:
$$ d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2} $$

### Lorentz Force
The force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field:
$$ \vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) $$

## Applications

1. **Electric Motors and Generators**
2. **Magnetic Storage Devices**
3. **Medical Imaging (e.g., MRI)**
