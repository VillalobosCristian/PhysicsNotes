# Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism is the branch of physics that studies the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. It encompasses a wide range of phenomena, from electricity and magnetism to electromagnetic waves.

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **Electric Fields**: Regions around charged particles where electric forces are exerted.
2. **Magnetic Fields**: Regions around magnets where magnetic forces are exerted.
3. **Maxwell's Equations**: A set of four fundamental equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Coulomb's Law
Describes the force between two point charges:
$$ \vec{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

### Faraday's Law of Induction
Describes how a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field:
$$ \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} $$

## Applications

Electromagnetism is fundamental to numerous technologies:
1. **Electric Power Generation**
2. **Telecommunications**
3. **Medical Imaging (e.g., MRI)**
4. **Electronics and Circuit Design**
