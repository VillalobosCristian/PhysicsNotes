# Electric Fields

Electric fields are regions around charged particles where electric forces are exerted on other charged particles. They are fundamental to understanding electricity and many other phenomena in physics.

## Basic Concepts

### Coulomb's Law
Describes the force between two point charges:
$$ \vec{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

### Electric Potential
The electric potential \( V \) at a point is the work done per unit charge to bring a positive test charge from infinity to that point:
$$ V = \frac{k_e q}{r} $$

## Applications

1. **Capacitors**: Devices that store electric energy.
2. **Electric Circuits**: Fundamental to all electronic devices.
3. **Electrostatics**: Study of stationary electric charges.
