# Maxwell's Equations

Maxwell's Equations are a set of four fundamental equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.

## The Four Equations

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**
   $$ \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} $$

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**
   $$ \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 $$

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**
   $$ \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} $$

4. **Amp√®re's Law (with Maxwell's addition)**
   $$ \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} $$

## Implications

- **Electromagnetic Waves**: Maxwell's Equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate through space at the speed of light.
- **Unified Theory**: They unify electricity, magnetism, and optics into a single theoretical framework.

## Applications

1. **Radio and Television Broadcasting**
2. **Wireless Communication**
3. **Optical Technologies**
