# Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental theory in quantum mechanics that states it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle.

## Mathematical Formulation
$$ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$

## Implications

- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Reinforces the concept that particles exhibit both wave and particle characteristics.
- **Measurement Limitations**: Highlights the fundamental limits of measurement in quantum systems.

## Applications

1. **Quantum Cryptography**
2. **Quantum Optics**
3. **Particle Physics**
