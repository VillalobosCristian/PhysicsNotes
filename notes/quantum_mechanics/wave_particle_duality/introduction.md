# Wave-Particle Duality

Wave-Particle Duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that every particle exhibits both wave and particle properties.

## Key Experiments

1. **Double-Slit Experiment**
   - Demonstrates interference patterns, indicative of wave behavior.
2. **Photoelectric Effect**
   - Shows that light can eject electrons, indicative of particle behavior (photons).

## Mathematical Representation

- **De Broglie Wavelength**
  $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$

## Implications

- **Complementarity Principle**: Wave and particle aspects are complementary; both are necessary for a complete description of quantum phenomena.
- **Quantum Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.

## Applications

1. **Electron Microscopy**
2. **Quantum Computing**
3. **Photonic Devices**
