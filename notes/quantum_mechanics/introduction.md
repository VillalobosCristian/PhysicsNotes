# Quantum Mechanics

Quantum Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic scales. It introduces concepts that differ significantly from classical physics, such as quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, and the uncertainty principle.

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
2. **Quantization of Energy**: Energy levels are discrete rather than continuous.
3. **Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle.

## Mathematical Framework

### Schrödinger Equation
Describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time:
$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\psi $$

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
Mathematically expressed as:
$$ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$

## Applications

Quantum Mechanics underpins many modern technologies:
1. **Semiconductor Devices**
2. **Quantum Computing**
3. **Lasers**
4. **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)**
